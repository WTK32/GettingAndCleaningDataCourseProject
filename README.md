## Course Project for Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data by JHU

*by Wan-Ting Kuo*



This is the project in week 4 for Getting and Cleaning Data course by JHU on Coursera. As described on the instruction, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data is from the experiments run on 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Each volunteer performed each activity at different number of times. Various measurements were captured for each activity performed by 30 different volunteers. The goal of this analysis is to provide a summary table that shows the average of every mean and standard deviation measurement for each activity and each volunteer. 


### The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.md'

- 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

- 'run_analysis.R': R codes used to clean the data and produce the analysis. 

- 'Summary.txt': A text file that shows the average of every mean and standard deviation measurement for each activity and each volunteer.

- 'Summary.xlsx': An excel file that shows the average of every mean and standard deviation measurement for each activity and each volunteer.
